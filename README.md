Meep (or MEEP) is a free finite-difference time-domain (FDTD)
simulation software package developed at MIT to model electromagnetic
systems.  You can download Meep and learn more about it at the Meep
home page:

The Meep home page also links to a meep-discuss mailing list for
discussions about Meep and FDTD simulations, and a meep-announce
mailing list for announcements of Meep releases.

"MEEP" stands for: MIT Electromagnetic Equation Propagation
